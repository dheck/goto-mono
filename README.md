# Goto Mono fonts

Goto Mono is a set of typewriter fonts derived from Google's Noto Sans Mono 
Condensed. The main difference to the Noto fonts is the addition of italics.
The italic glyphs are simply skewed versions of the upright glyphs.
Goto Mono supports the following styles:

- Goto Mono Regular
- Goto Mono Italic
- Goto Mono Bold
- Goto Mono Bold Italic

For an example, see [this PDF file](GotoMonoSample.pdf).

The fonts are published under the [SIL Open Font License (OFL) v1.1](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL), which allows you to copy, modify, and redistribute them if you need to.
